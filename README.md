Data Analytics class, Module 6 assignment
Much of the syntax for both projects comes from in-class assignments.  For some specifics, the linear regression syntax inside the function is almost entirely from in-class assignments, and the map plotting uses the same format and variable names as we learned in class as well.  The only thing pulled from a website outside of class was the time.strftime function in WeatherPy:

date_accessed = time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')

this time.strftime syntax came from https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-standard-library/0596000960/ch01s15.html
